# TryHackMe-Oneliners
This repository wil contain a few onliner solutions for CTFs in TryHackMe. The point of this is to challenge myself to come up with elegant automation scripts that can be easily replicated with 1 or 2 commands.
This is intended for learning purposes and for me to practice my skills. I highly recommend for you to figure out the CTF yourself first and then try this for fun
